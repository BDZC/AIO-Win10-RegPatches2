Description:
------------
WhoCrashed reveals the drivers responsible for crashing your
computer. Whenever a computer running Windows suddenly reboots
without displaying any notice or blue screen of death, the first
thing that is often thought about is a hardware failure. In
reality, most crashes are caused by malfunctioning device
drivers and kernel modules. In case of a kernel error, most
computers running Windows do not show a blue screen unless they
are configured to do so. Instead these systems suddenly reboot
without any notice.

WhoCrashed shows the drivers which have been crashing computer
with a single click. Normally, debugging skills and a set of
debugging tools are required to do post-mortem crash dump
analysis. This program checks for available crash dump files and
checks for reponsible modules. In most cases it can pinpoint the
offending drivers which have been causing misery on your
computer system in the past. It does post-mortem crashdump
analysis and presents all gathered information in a
comprehensible way.

By using this utility you do not need any debugging skills to be
able to find out what is and has been causing trouble on your
computer. Even to expert users, this tool will save a lot of
time.

The home edition is licensed for use at home only.

The professional edition allows analyzing crash dumps on remote
computers in the network and offers a range of additional
features including symbol resolution and kernel stack traces.
